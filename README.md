# SeedStar-JenkinsAPI
SeedStar Pyhton Software Engineering Challenge, communicating with JenkinsAPI
The python3.5 script connects to jenkinsAPI which was available in my local machine as https://localhost:8080 (put your url)
It will require your Jenkins username and password to connect, replace mine with yours.
SQLite database was used to log job status from Jenkins.
Enjoy!!!
